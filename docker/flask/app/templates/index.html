    <h2>Rules:</h2>
    <p>
      This database is designed to track relationships between individuals
      within the school community. Please refrain from logging information about
      random people from outside of school, that one dude you met at UCPA last
      summer should not be in this database. We aim to maintain a database
      focused on people known to others within the school.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule of thumb, log information about someone only if one of the
      following conditions is met:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>They have been at the Lycée or Charles de Gaulle at some point</li>
      <li>
        At least two people got with them and they are from London (no vacation
        people)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please do not log about people in Year 10 or bellow. The database should
      include only information about lycéean students.
    </p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>
      This website offers a funny way to visualize the relationships among
      people within our school. The data is stored in a graph database, which
      organizes data into nodes (such as people) and edges (representing
      relationships). This is why the website was created as exploring the
      relationships among people in our school seemed like an interesting way to
      learn about graphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, by putting this online, some considerations have arrised. It is
      important to note that the actual data itself was not given much
      consideration, so it should not be taken too seriously. Nevertheless, we
      believe that as different individuals contribute information to this
      database, it will become more interesting and accurate. Our intention is
      not to cause any unnecessary drama. If there is any information about you
      that you are uncomfortable with being shared here, please inform us, and
      we will promptly remove it without further questions (although if it's
      here, it's likely already common knowledge within the school). We welcome
      any suggestions or feedback you may have.
    </p>
